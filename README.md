# Jobylon - A simple job-list app

This is what we have in mind for the test. It should in the end show us a little more about how you solve problems, how you structure your code and what you care about when developing.

Try showcasing the things you think are important in a project and think about your project architecture as if it was a larger project. If there is not enough time, please take notes during your development and submit them on the feedback form together with your code.

The use-case is very simple:

    1. User types a URL in the browser
    2. User is presented with a list of jobs
    3. The user can interact with the jobs in the list and follow a link to the actual ads.

The site in question where you should get the jobs from is one of the following:
XML - https://feed.jobylon.com/feeds/7d7e6fd12c614aa5af3624b06f7a74b8/
JSON - https://feed.jobylon.com/feeds/7d7e6fd12c614aa5af3624b06f7a74b8/?format=json

Non functional requirements:
_ Use React, and create-react-app as a basis to complete your assignment
_ It should work in a modern browser (Chrome or Firefox)
_ Either the app has to be hosted somewhere online or you have to write some instructions on how to get it up and running on Mac/Linux
_ I also need to get access to all the source code, be it on Github, Bitbucket or just a tar.gz...

Please motivate your choices (UX and Code) on the feedback form where you submit your code.

BONUS:
If you want to impress, feel free to put a special touch on the UI.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out at any time.
